# Soapp (Android)

Original Android Java codes for Soapp chat app. This was the very first project that I wrote, and it was for the tech startup I co-founded. Written from scratch in a small studio apartment around 2016, the codebase was written in pure Java and started out with the old RecyclerView and SQLite database, which were only migrated to Android X later on, after securing angel investment funds with the MVP written with this very same codebase.
