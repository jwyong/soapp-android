# Soapp (Android)

Original Android Java codes for Soapp chat app. This was the very first project that I wrote, and it was for the tech startup I co-founded. Written from scratch in a small studio apartment around 2016, the codebase was written in pure Java and started out with the old RecyclerView and SQLite database, which were only migrated to Android X later on, after securing angel investment funds with the MVP written with this very same codebase.

Some core functions include sending of media (record audio, camera image and video), location sharing via chat, group chat and management, appointment linked to chat, restaurant directory based on GPS location, sharing of restaurants to chat and setting it to appointment with others, realtime GPS location sharing via chat / group chat (before Live tracking was introduced in WhatsApp), and many other realtime chat / group chat related functionalities.

Core frameworks used were WorkManager, Room database, XMPP Framework (Smack library), camera / gallery API, FCM Messaging Service, GPS and others.
